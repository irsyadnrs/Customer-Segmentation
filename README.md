# Customer-Segmentation
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets. Those efforts can relate to both communications and product development.  These analytics aiming to divide customers into 2 types, such as the amount of purchase & place of purchase.

I used marketing data from Kaggle.com and updated it 9 months ago. There are 2.240 customers and 28 variables, but I just used some variables that accord with my purpose. I used R and K- Means clustering method for dividing customers by amount of purchase and place of purchase.
